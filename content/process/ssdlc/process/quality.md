tldr: Functionality of software is assured prior to production
rationale: Every change has the potential to introduce regressions in functionality.  By testing our software prior to deployment we manage the risk of production issues.

## Background

If it matters that a software system functions according to expectations, we must test and qualify our software prior to production. The level of testing and qualification should correspond to the risk appetite for a particular system.  Testing can be either manual or automated (however we recommend automated approaches such as unit testing).  Regardless of the approach, the testing approach must be systematic and test results documented.

The benefits of automated approaches to regression testing include:

* Less manual work
* More consistent testing
* Faster lead times
* Improved knowledge sharing
* Automated test results documentation
