# The Secure SDLC Process Template

{{< process_table >}}

## Overview

The secure SDLC process template is an open source definition for a software 
delivery process. You can fork this template to satisfy the software delivery process 
requirement for any industry standard, including SOC2, ISO27001, IEC62304, NIST, FedRAMP, etc.

For SOC2 you'll need an defined process for CC8 - Common Critera 8

For ISO27001  you'll need it for A.14.2.1 - Secure Development Policy

For IEC62304 it's in section 5.1 - 5.8 - Software development process

If you are struggling to define a software delivery process for compliance with a 
standard, and you're not really sure what to do, and you just want an easy button 
for a generic SDLC - you can fork this repo. It's a secure sdlc framework that's 
applicable to any standard.

As an example, we recently forked the repo ourselves as part of our SOC2 process. 
You can see what that looks like over here https://sdlc.kosli.com/

If you're interested in discovering how to automate the *proof* that you're 
following your SDLC - gathering evidence for tests, security scans, pull requests, etc
